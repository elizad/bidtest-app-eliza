### Fullstack track

1. Set up an application where data in `competitions.json` can be loaded and stored in a database.
2. Build an API which aligns to the competition data, and its associated business logic. Include any validation you deem relevant.
3. In the frontend, consume the `competitions` endpoint
4. Build a data structure to represent competition `names` grouped by their status
5. Display this data on a single page. We've intentionally left this vague.
6. Update the README with any provisioning steps for running the code and/or tests
